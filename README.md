# CosmoMIA

[![Build Status](https://github.com/dforero0896/CosmoMIA.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/dforero0896/CosmoMIA.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


The **Cosmo**logical **M**ultiscale **I**nfall **A**lgorithm is developed to overcome the limitations of low resolution yet fast cosmological simulations, which are unable to resolve the clustering below the mesh resolution used to compute the evolved dark matter field. It does so by 1. Placing galaxy tracers using the available dark matter particles, 2. cleverly placing randomly sampled particles as required and 3. a 2-step collapse model that takes into account the cosmic web environment of each particle in order to tune the pairwise positions in order to better match the small scale clustering of the reference. Full details of the method can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17581).

## Usage
The `examples/cosmoMIA_run.jl` directory contains a full example of how to run the code in fitting and production mode, however it should not be run under the `CosmoMIA` project in order to avoid burdening the package with extra dependencies. To use the code you should first
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/dforero0896/CosmoCorr.jl.git
pkg> add https://github.com/dforero0896/CosmoMIA.jl.git#script
```
which should install the required dependencies in your designed project directory. After, trying to run `examples/cosmoMIA_run.jl` will prompt you to download the extra dependencies (i.e. for plotting).
The code needs, in principle, the results of a cosmological simulation, which we take to be the final dark matter particle positions, Eulerian velocities, displacement fields, dark matter overdensity field and cosmic web (Tweb) classification. The example is set to receive a target catalog and compute the target clustering, but it could be modified to accept some target clustering instead, just make sure the binning matches.
